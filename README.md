 # Tamsakay

## a.) Project Description
  
  Students and faculty staff at FEU often do not know the schedules of campus shuttles, which causes delays and frustration. Drivers also face challenges in organizing their trips without proper tools. Tamsakay is an app that will show shuttle schedules and allow students and faculty staff to plan their shuttle. The system ensures that students and staff can easily check in when arriving at the waiting area, while drivers and administrators manage their respective tasks with minimal confusion.
  
The Tamsakay Shuttle Tracker System is a software solution developed for managing the shuttle service at Far Eastern University (FEU). It is designed to simplify the way students, staff, drivers, and administrators interact with the shuttle system, ensuring a smoother and more organized process.

By using QR codes for user check-ins and providing real-time notifications from drivers, Tamsakay enhances communication and streamlines shuttle operations without requiring complex infrastructure. Additionally, it allows users, such as students and staff, to view the availability status of shuttle drivers. Whether they are available, unavailable, or on their way to specific pickup points like the main gate.

This feature helps users plan their trips more effectively, reduces waiting times, and avoids confusion at shuttle stops. The system also empowers drivers and administrators by minimizing manual communication and providing a centralized platform for tracking and scheduling.

## b.) Market analysis

### Target Users:

**Students:**

  Comprising the majority of the university population, students are the primary users of the shuttle service. The system should also allow students to check if a driver is available, unavailable, or already on the way to specific locations like the main gate. They need a simple and reliable system to ensure they can board shuttles on time without unnecessary waiting.

**Staff and Faculty:**

  University staff and faculty members also depend on the shuttle service for campus transportation. Their schedules often demand punctuality, making it essential to know the availability of shuttles.

**Shuttle Drivers:**

  Drivers benefit from a system that allows them to communicate their availability without manually addressing individual inquiries.

**FEU Administration:**

  The administration is responsible for managing the shuttle service.

**Parents:**

  Parents visiting the campus for events or meetings need a clear and simple way to know how to use the shuttle service. This helps them plan their visit smoothly.

**Visitors:**

  Guests visiting the university for events or tours need access to the shuttle service.

### Competitor Analysis

-  **Growing Number of Shuttle Users:**
      With a significant number of students and staff relying on the shuttle service daily, managing the increasing volume of users becomes challenging without a proper system.
  
-   **Need for Time Management:**
       Students and staff value their time, and waiting unnecessarily for shuttles affects productivity and satisfaction.
     
-  **Fair and Secure Access to Shuttles:**
      The QR code system ensures that only authorized users can access the service, preventing misuse and overcrowding.

 -  **Modernization of Campus Services:**
      As universities adopt more technology-driven solutions, implementing a system like Tamsakay aligns with efforts to modernize campus operations.

### Strengths of Tamsakay:

-  	Simple and easy-to-use system tailored for the specific needs of FEU.
-   No need for expensive infrastructure or advanced technologies to function effectively.
-   Focuses on improving communication and organization without overwhelming users.

## c.) Technical Specifications

### Technologies Used

-  #### Frontend Technologies:
  **HTML and CSS** for creating a user-friendly interface.
  
  **Javascript** for dynamic features and interactivity.

-  #### 	Backend Technologies:
  **PHP** for server-side processing and system logic.
  
  **MySQL** for managing and storing user, driver, and shuttle data.

### Length of Time Required
Planning and Design:

Timeframe: 1–2 weeks

Activities: Gathering requirements, designing the system architecture, and creating wireframes for the interface.
Development:

Timeframe: 4–6 weeks

Activities: Writing the code for the frontend, backend, and database, and integrating all components.

Testing and Debugging:

Timeframe: 2–3 weeks

Activities: Performing unit, integration, and user acceptance testing; fixing any identified bugs.

## d.) Risk Analysis

**-System Downtime**
The system could stop working due to software bugs, server crashes, or other technical problems. This would stop users from scanning QR codes, checking shuttle statuses, or using other features.

**-Data Loss or Corruption**
Data might get lost or damaged if the system crashes or there is a mistake while updating information.

**-Lack of Familiarity with the System**
Some users may not know how to use the system properly, leading to frustration or improper use

**-Internet Dependency**
The system relies on internet access for most of its features to function, such as scanning QR codes, checking driver statuses, or receiving updates. Users without a stable internet connection will not be able to use the system effectively, creating a disadvantage for those in areas with poor connectivity or those who do not have access to mobile data.

## e.) Describe the possible solutions

 - Implementation of regular backups of all important data to ensure that no information is lost in the event of a crash.  also perform regular testing and maintenance to identify potential issues early. Regular checks on the system will be conducted to monitor its performance and stability, ensuring that it operates without interruptions.

  - Simple guides and instructions should be provided. Short tutorials can show new users how to use the system easily. Admins can also offer training or help through a support team. Making the system easy to use and providing quick help will reduce confusion and make it easier for everyone to use.

- To accommodate future growth, the system can be designed with scalability in mind. As the university grows, the system can handle an increasing number of students, drivers, and shuttles without losing performance.

## f.) Evaluation Criteria

**Usability**
The system must be user-friendly to ensure smooth operation and encourage widespread adoption by students, drivers, and admins.

**Cost Effectiveness**
The system must fit within the budget constraints of the university, considering both short-term and long-term costs.

**Scalability**
The system should be able to accommodate future growth and changes in shuttle usage.

**Reliability**
The system must be reliable to avoid disruptions in service and ensure students, drivers, and admins can access the shuttle service at all times.

**Security**
 is critical to ensure the privacy and safety of users and the integrity of the system.

**Accessibility**
The system is designed to be user-friendly and accessible through web browsers, making it compatible with a wide range of devices, including smartphones, tablets, and computers. This approach eliminates the need for additional software installations

## h.) Conclusion
The Tamsakay Shuttle Tracker project aims to make shuttle management at Far Eastern University easier with a simple QR code-based system. This solution is affordable and can grow as the university's needs change. Students will only need to scan a QR code to check in, which keeps things simple and avoids the need for complex technology or extra hardware, making it a practical choice for the university. It also ensures that both students and administrators can use the system easily.

The QR code system also provides security, reliability, and flexibility. It keeps student data safe while helping admins and drivers efficiently manage the shuttle services. The system is easy to set up and maintain, with low costs for both starting and ongoing support.

In addition to simplifying check-ins, the system includes features that allow students and staff to track shuttle availability, view driver statuses _(e.g., available, unavailable, or on the way to key pickup points like the main gate)_ and receive notifications about shuttle updates. This ensures better communication and helps reduce waiting times.

With its simplicity, scalability, and potential for future improvements, Tamsakay addresses the shuttle scheduling challenges faced by the FEU community with a practical and user-friendly approach. By focusing on static schedules and essential notifications, it ensures timely communication between students, faculty, and drivers. The app's development will significantly improve transportation efficiency, reduce frustration, and provide a foundation for potential future enhancements
